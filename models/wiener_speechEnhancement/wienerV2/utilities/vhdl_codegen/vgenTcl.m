% vgenTcl Generate an TCL script from a json input file
%
% vgenTcl(infile, outfile)
%
% The json file this function expects has a specific format that contains information about the vhdl entity and
% the Avalon streaming interface parameters. This will often be generated by MATLAB/Simulink, but it can also be written
% by hand. An example of the format is shown below. This function calls a
% python script autogen_tcl.py that generates the tcl script that allows
% the simulink model to be seen as a custom component in Platform Designer
% in Quartus
%
% Inputs:
%   infile = the json input filename
%   outfile = the tcl output filename
