# Fast Fourier Transform Analysis/Synthesis Models
This folder contains model references that provide a framework for frequency-domain processing:
- `fft_analysis`: transform audio into the frequency domain
- `fft_synthesis`: transform back into the time domain
- `fast_fourier_transform_sim`: a full simulation model that performs analysis and synthesis using the `fft_analysis`  and `fft_synthesis` models

These models were developed for use with the Frost Autogen Framework. To set up Frost Autogen, please review the [Getting Started Guides](https://github.com/fpga-open-speech-tools/docs/tree/master/getting_started). 

## Algorithm
A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to transform audio into the frequency domain (known as [Fourier Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis)), after which frequency-domain processing can be performed; after processing, an inverse FFT (iFFT) is used to synthesize the time-domain audio from it's frequency spectrum (known as Fourier Synthesis). The models contained here implement the [Short-time Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-time_Fourier_transform) (STFT) and inverse STFT; the inverse STFT is implemented using the [overlap-and-add method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlap%E2%80%93add_method).

The following figure shows a graphical example of the STFT overlap-and-add method. The blue input signal is split up into 5 overlapped windows, and then transformed into the frequency domain. After processing in the frequency domain, an inverse FFT is applied to get the blue output signals, which are overlapped and added together to produce the final output signal.

## Usage
The `fft_analysis` and `fft_synthesis` models are intended be used as [model references](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/model-reference.html). To do frequency-domain processing, add the `fft_analysis` and `fft_synthesis` models to your model as referenced models. You will pass the audio into the `fft_analysis` block, do your desired frequency-domain processing on the `FFT_data` signal, then feed processed FFT data into the `modified_FFT_data` port of the `fft_synthesis` block. 

For a basic example of connecting the analysis and synthesis blocks together, see `fast_fourier_transform_sim`. For concrete examples of frequency-domain processing, see the [FFT filters](../fft_filters) model. 

When using the analysis and synthesis models, you need to implement all the parameters found in the `%% Model parameters` section of `modelparameters.m`; the variable names **can not be changed** without having to change them in the analysis and synthesis models. The only model parameter you should change is `mp.FFT_size`. All other parameters are derived parameters; **changing them will break the analysis and synthesis models**. 

## Implementation
The incoming audio signal is buffered into a dual-port RAM that is twice the FFT size. Once the buffer is full, data is read out in bursts at a rate 32-times faster than the sampling rate. The STFT is implemented with Hanning windows that are overlapped by 1/4 of the FFT size.
