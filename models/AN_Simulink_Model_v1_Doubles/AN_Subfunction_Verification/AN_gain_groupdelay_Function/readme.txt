% gain_groupdelay readme.txt File
% 06/27/2019

The AN_gain_groupdelay folder contains all the files necessary for
testing/verification of the gain_groupdelay MATLAB function, a part of the AN
Simulink Model init script.

To test/verify the MATLAB function, simply navigate to the AN_gain_groupdelay folder
in MATLAB, and edit the parameters in the Verify_gain_groupdelay MATLAB script if
desired. Then, run the Verify_gain_groupdelay script.

The Verify_gain_groupdelay script declares the necessary test parameters and compiles
a MEX wrapper, which allows the C function Get_gain_groupdelay_mex to be ran through
MATLAB. Then, both the gain_groupdelay MATLAB function and the gain_groupdelay_mex C
function are called. The outputs are compared, and the error is displayed in
the MATLAB command window. This error represents the difference between the
gain_groupdelay C source code function and the gain_groupdelay MATLAB function used in the
AN Simulink Model.
