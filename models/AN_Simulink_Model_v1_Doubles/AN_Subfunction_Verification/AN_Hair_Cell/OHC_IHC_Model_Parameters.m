%% NOTES

% The following list of parameters are the highest level inputs to the AN
% Simulink Model. Editing these parameters will have an effect on other
% model parameters, calculated both in 'OHC_IHC_Get_Parameters.m' and the
% Simulink Model itself

%% DECLARING PARAMETERS

% characteristic frequency of the neuron
cf = 1000; 

% sampling rate
Fs = 48e3;

% histogram binsize in seconds, defined as 1/sampling rate
tdres = 1/Fs;

% number of repititions for the peri-stimulus time histogram
nrep = 100; 

% outer hair cell impairment constant ( from 0 to 1 )
cohc = 1; 

% inner hair cell impairment constant ( from 0 to 1 )
cihc = 1;

% species associated with model ( 1 for cat, 2 or 3 for human )
species = 2;

% Absolute refractory period
tabs   = 0.6e-3; 

% Baseline mean relative refractory period
trel   = 0.6e-3;
