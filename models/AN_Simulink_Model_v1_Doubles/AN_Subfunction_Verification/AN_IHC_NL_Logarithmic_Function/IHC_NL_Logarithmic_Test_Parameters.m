%% NOTES

% The following script is designed as an init script for the IHC NL
% Logarithmic Function Simulink model. It sets the parameters for both the 
% Simulink model and the comparison MATLAB function. In addition, it 
% provides the test signal, set to a frequency sweep from 125 Hz to 20000 
% Hz in 4 seconds, sampled at 48 kHz.


%% AN MODEL INPUTS

% Overall AN model inputs

% Characteristic frequency of specific neuron, chosen arbitrarily for
% testing (but must be greater than 125 - see model_IHC_BEZ2018)
cf = 1000;

% Sampling frequency
Fs = 48e3;

% Binsize in seconds
tdres = 1/Fs;

% Number of repititions for peri-stimulus time histogram
nrep = 100; 

% Impairment constants
cohc = 1; 
cihc = 1; 

% Species (1 for cat, 2 or 3 for human)
species = 2;

%% IHC NL LOGARITHMIC FUNCTION PARAMETERS

% Ratio of positive Max to negative Max
ihcasym = 3.0;

% Hard-coded as 0.1 or 0.2 in source code, depending on if it's the output
% of the C1 or C2 filter
slope = 0.1;

% Function specific parameters
corner    = 80; 
strength  = (20.0e6)/(10^(corner/20));


%% TEST SIGNAL

% Test signal set to chirp signal moving linearly over time from 125 Hz to
% 20000 Hz, sampled at 48 kHz.

% read in chirp signal
[tone,fs] = audioread('AN_test_tone.wav');

% Assign to variable used in model
RxSignal = tone;

% Find test time, which is set in model
testtime = length(RxSignal)/Fs

% end of script
