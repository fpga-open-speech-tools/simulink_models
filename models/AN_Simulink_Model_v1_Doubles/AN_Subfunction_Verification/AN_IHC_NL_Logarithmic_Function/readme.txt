% IHC NL Logarithmic Function readme.txt File
% 06/26/2019

The AN_IHC_NL_Logarithmic_Function folder contains all the files necessary for
testing/verification of the IHC NL Logarithmic Function Simulink model,
a part of the AN Simulink model.

To test/verify the Simulink model, simply edit the
IHC_NL_Logarithmic_Test_Parameters MATLAB script parameters if desired.
Next, navigate to the AN_IHC_NL_Logarithmic_Function folder in MATLAB.
Then, open and run the IHC_NL_Logarithmic_Function Simulink model.

The model calls the IHC_NL_Logarithmic_Test_Parameters init script,
declaring the parameters in the MATLAB workspace. The Simulink model then uses
those parameters to manipulate the test signal, also declared in the
parameters MATLAB script. Once the output of the Simulink model is calculated,
the model calls the Verify_IHC_NL_Logarithmic_Function MATLAB script,
which creates a MEX wrapper and then calls the NLogarithm C function to
calculate the output. The MEX wrapper allows for the C function to be
executed after it is called in MATLAB. The NLogarithm C function works exactly
like the NLogarithm function in the model_IHC_BEZ2018 C source code file,
and serves as a golden reference to which the Simulink model can be compared.

The verify script will output a comparison plot of the two results. It will
also print an error value to the Simulink Diagnostics window.
