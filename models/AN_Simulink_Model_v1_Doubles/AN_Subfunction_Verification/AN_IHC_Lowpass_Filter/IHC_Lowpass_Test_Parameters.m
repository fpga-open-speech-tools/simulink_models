%% NOTES

% The following script is designed as an init script for the IHC Lowpass
% Filter Simulink model. It sets the parameters for both the 
% Simulink model and the comparison MATLAB function. In addition, it 
% provides the test signal, set to a frequency sweep from 125 Hz to 20000 
% Hz in 4 seconds, sampled at 48 kHz.


%% AN MODEL INPUTS

% Overall AN model inputs

% Characteristic frequency of specific neuron, chosen arbitrarily for
% testing (but must be greater than 125 - see model_IHC_BEZ2018)
cf = 1000;

% Sampling frequency
Fs = 48e3;

% Binsize in seconds
tdres = 1/Fs;

% Number of repititions for peri-stimulus time histogram
nrep = 100; 

% Impairment constants
cohc = 1; 
cihc = 1; 

% Species (1 for cat, 2 or 3 for human)
species = 2;

%% IHC LOWPASS FILTER PARAMETERS

% Declaring 2 pi constant
TWOPI= 6.28318530717959; 

% Function Inputs:
Fcihc = 3000;
gainihc = 1.0;
orderihc = 7;

% Calculated Constants
C = 2.0/tdres;
c1LPihc = ( C - TWOPI*Fcihc ) / ( C + TWOPI*Fcihc );
c2LPihc = TWOPI*Fcihc / (TWOPI*Fcihc + C);


%% TEST SIGNAL

% Test signal set to chirp signal moving linearly over time from 125 Hz to
% 20000 Hz, sampled at 48 kHz.

% read in chirp signal
[tone,fs] = audioread('AN_test_tone.wav');

% Assign to variable used in model
RxSignal = tone;

% Find test time, which is set in model
testtime = length(RxSignal)/Fs

% end of script
