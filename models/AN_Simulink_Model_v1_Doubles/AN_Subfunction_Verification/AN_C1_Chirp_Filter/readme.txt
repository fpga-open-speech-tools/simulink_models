% C1 Chirp Filter readme.txt File
% 06/27/2019

The AN_C1_Chirp_Filter folder contains all the files necessary for
testing/verification of the C1 Chirp Filter Simulink model,
a part of the AN Simulink model.

To test/verify the Simulink model, simply edit the
C1_Chirp_Test_Parameters MATLAB script parameters if desired.
Next, navigate to the AN_C1_Chirp_Filter folder in MATLAB.
Then open and run the C1_Chirp_Filter Simulink model.

The model calls the C1_Chirp_Test_Parameters init script,
declaring the parameters in the MATLAB workspace. The Simulink model then uses
those parameters to calculate the C1 coefficients, then filter the test signal,
also declared in the parameters MATLAB script. Once the output of the
Simulink model is calculated, the model calls the Verify_C1_Chirp_Filter
MATLAB script, which creates a MEX wrapper and then calls the C1ChirpFilt
C function to calculate the filter output. The MEX wrapper allows for the
C function to be executed after it is called in MATLAB. The C1ChirpFilt
C function works exactly like the C1ChirpFilt function in the
model_IHC_BEZ2018 C source code file, and serves as a golden reference to
which the Simulink model can be compared.

The verify script will output a comparison plot of the two results. It will
also print an error value to the Simulink Diagnostics window.
