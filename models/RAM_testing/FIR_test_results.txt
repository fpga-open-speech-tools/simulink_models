Board synthesized for: 5CSEBA6U23I7
Coefficient set: 
	Lowpass filter, total of 577 coefficients, 577 are nonzero. 

The goal of this test is to identify the resource usage, RAM block usage, and latency of different types of FIR filters.
There will need to be a set of 3 possible filter coefficient sets, each defined before runtime.

These FIRs will need to be programmable. Current ideas are:
Discretized FIR filter:
	Use 3 filter blocks, with predefined coefficients.
	OR
	Use 1 filter, with 3 RAM blocks (or something similar) containing the coefficient sets, 
	 and a demultiplexer to choose one bus to send as the input to the filter. 
	
Discrete FIR filter HDL optimized:
	Use 3 filter blocks with predefined coefficients.
	OR
	Use 1 filter, with 3 RAM blocks (or something similar) containing the coefficient sets, 
	 and a demultiplexer to choose one bus to send as the input to the filter. 
	 
Use a FIFO and a predefined bus of constants:
	1 FIFO, 1 of 3 sets of coefficients sent into a demux sent into a dot multiply block with the FIFO.
		- Define a vertical constant for the coefficient sets?


Initial testing: 1 set of coefficients. No RAMs.

Using the Discretized FIR filter:
	Using 1 filter block, no RAMs.
	Shown to not fit on device. Utilized 987% of board ALMs (logic utilization).
	This is seemingly due to the Discre_FIR_Filter_1.vhd file being so massive it can't fit. Even in such a simple implementation, 
		having each coefficient maintain it's own multiply, delay_pipeline signal, product and coefficient variable is not efficient enough.
	I'd like to point out it took over 11 minutes to fail 30% through compilation in Quartus, where the fitter threw an error (too large).
	93,000 ALMs. 18530 registers. 0 block memory or RAM blocks. 
		
Switching over to the HDL optimized Discrete FIR Filter:
Valid always set to 1, though this is within a triggered subsystem.
	Latency: 296 (6.1667 msec at 48 kHz)
		This is a very high latency, high enough to be concerning. 
		It takes up about 50% of our total latency budget (at 10+ msec the delay is noticable)
	64289 ALMs (682%). 62890 registers.  36 (100%) DSP blocks.
