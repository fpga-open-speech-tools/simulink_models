%%This function imeplements an adaptive wiener filter that attenuates white
%%noise by using sample-based statistical approximation. It uses a
%%look-behind window to keep track of statistical variance and means to
%%estimate the SNR(?) and filters the signal sample-by-sample.

% Inputs:
%           noisyAudio  - Noisy speech signal
%           Fs          - Sample rate
%           windowSize  - Size of Window [0 5] ms
% Outputs:
%           sn          - Filtered Output Signal
