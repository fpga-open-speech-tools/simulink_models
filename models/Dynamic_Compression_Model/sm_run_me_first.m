%% Fast simulation
% Fast simulation reduces the Fs_system clock rate to reduce the number of
% simulated clock cycles between each sample in the Avalon bus signals.
% It also reduces the number of stimulus samples.  This allow for faster
% development iterations when developing the simulink model.
