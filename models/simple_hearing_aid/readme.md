# A Simple Hearing Aid
This simple hearing aid example is a combination of the [Adaptive Wiener Filter Noise Suppression Model](../noise_suppression) and the [FFT Filter Model](../fft_filters).
This model was developed using the Frost Autogen Framework and deployed to an Audio Mini using Frost Edge. To set up Frost Autogen or Frost Edge, please review the [Getting Started Guides](https://github.com/fpga-open-speech-tools/docs/tree/master/getting_started).

## Usage
- `System Enable`: Enable or disable the audio processing.  Audio will pass directly from input to output when this processing is disabled.
- **Noise Suppression Controls**:
    - `Noise Suppression Enable`: Enable or disable the noise suppression.
    - `Noise Variance`: The amount of noise suppression can be varied at runtime, which ranges from 0 to 1
- **Left Channel FFT Filter Controls**: 
    - `Left Channel FFT Filter Enable`: Enable or disable the FFT filters for the left audio channel.
    - `Left Channel FFT Filter Selection`: These are defined in [model parameters](modelparameters.m). *Note the filter parameters are the same for both channels because of the model referencing.*
        - `LPF`: Low Pass Filter from 0-4k Hz
        - `BPF`: Band Pass Filter from 4k-8k Hz
        - `HPF`: High Pass Filter from 8k Hz and up
        - `APF`: All Pass Filter
- **Right Channel FFT Filter Controls**: 
    - `Right Channel FFT Filter Enable`: Enable or disable the FFT filters for the right audio channel.
    - `Right ChannelFFT Filter Selection`: These are defined in [model parameters](modelparameters.m). *Note the filter parameters are the same for both channels because of the model referencing.*
        - `LPF`: Low Pass Filter from 0-4k Hz
        - `BPF`: Band Pass Filter from 4k-8k Hz
        - `HPF`: High Pass Filter from 8k Hz and up
        - `APF`: All Pass Filter


## Implementation
The Simple Hearing Aid model is implemented using the Adaptive Wiener Filter Noise Suppression Reference Model, the FFT Analysis and Synthesis Reference Models, and the FFT Filter Bank Reference Model. The Adaptive Wiener Filter processes both left and right audio channels before passing the data to the FFT Filter Blocks. The FFT Filter Bank processes the left channel and right channel independently before the two channels are vectorized and passed to the output.
